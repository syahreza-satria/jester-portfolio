                Hi, I'm Jester
                <br><br>
                I'm doing photography as a hobby, and I love to capture moments and create memories through my lens.
                <br><br>
                I started my photography journey as a way to do anything other than studying. I was bored with my
                studies, and I wanted to find something that I could enjoy and be passionate about. I started taking
                photos of my friends and family, and I quickly fell in love with the art of photography.
                <br><br>
                I mostly do potrait photography in events, and i loved the feels after taking a shot and it turned out
                really sharp like those high quality movies.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, I hope you enjoy my portfolio and find inspiration in my work. If you're interested in working
                with me or have any questions, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to new opportunities and
                collaborations.
            </p>
